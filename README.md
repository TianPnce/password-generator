# password-generator

## User Story
AS A new learner to JavaScript I WANT to use what I learned this week SO THAT I can build a password generator with prompts.

## Deployment

## Note
I need to work on how to store users responses, as well as working with window prompts, I was able to make a random length of character but was stuck on the prompt part of the assignment.
